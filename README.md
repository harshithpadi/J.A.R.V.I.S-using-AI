# J.A.R.V.I.S-using-AI
This project is based on artificial intelligence where I have desined an AI assistant .  A virtual assistant is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for a user.

##AI ASSISTAN - 
A virtual assistant, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.

A virtual assistant uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), RPA, natural language processing, and machine learning to extract information and complex data from conversations to understand them and process them accordingly.


##SPEECH RECOGNITION-
Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability of a machine or program to identify words spoken aloud and convert them into readable text. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary and may only identify words and phrases when spoken clearly.


##ALGORITHM - 

Step 1 – Start .

Step 2 -  Giving voice command to the systeam .

Step 3 -  Computer processing the voice and taking it as input .

Step 4 -   Converting the voice to texts .

Step 5 -  Processing the output by understanding the converted text.

Step 6 -  Repeat the process from step 2.

Step 7 - Countinuing the programam until “quit” command is given as input .

Step 8 – End.

INPUTS-
Inputs are the “commands” that the user will give through mike. The system will converts the voice to the command that will be understand by the computer.


So, by giving commands we can control not only online websites but also OS features also. It provides addition benefit to have  complete control of your pc by giving proper commands to it.
